      "Here’s a concise overview of the LangChain MCP Adapters library and how it fits into LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is it\n",
      "- The LangChain MCP Adapters library provides a bridge between the Anthropic Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools ecosystem and LangChain/LangGraph.\n",
      "- It converts MCP tools into LangChain- and LangGraph-compatible tools, enabling agents to call and orchestrate MCP tools as if they were native LangChain tools.\n",
      "- It supports tools across multiple MCP servers, so an agent can pull and use tools from many servers at once.\n",
      "- It integrates the hundreds of MCP tool servers already published into LangGraph agents, simplifying multi-server tool integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key features and what’s new (based on recent releases)\n",
      "- Multiserver support: Pull tools from multiple MCP servers and use them together in a single agent.\n",
      "- Multimodal tool support: Tools can accept/produce images, text, and other modalities.\n",
      "- Elicitation and clarifications: Easy support for prompt-driven clarifications and multi-turn interactions with MCP tools.\n",
      "- Structured tool outputs as artifacts: Tool results can be stored in a structured, inspectable format for easier downstream processing.\n",
      "- Tool name prefixes for multi-server setups: Helps avoid naming collisions when using tools from several MCP servers.\n",
      "- Documentation updates: There are dedicated docs showing how to use MCP with LangChain (OSS docs), plus changelog notes for MCP Adapters releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where it fits in the ecosystem\n",
      "- MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard for exposing tools and context to LLMs. MCP Adapters let LangChain/LangGraph agents use MCP-defined tools as if they were native tools.\n",
      "- The library is designed to work seamlessly with LangChain agents (and LangGraph) to orchestrate tools across one or more MCP servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Language/implementation variants\n",
      "- Python: The main LangChain MCP Adapters library is available as langchain-mcp-adapters (GitHub: langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters). It provides a client (MultiServerMCPClient) to connect to MCP servers and fetch tools, which you can then feed into LangChain agents.\n",
      "- JavaScript/TypeScript: There is a JavaScript/TypeScript variant (langchainjs-mcp-adapters) for LangChain.js, which provides similar functionality for the JS ecosystem. The repo notes indicate that the JS repo has moved/merged in some places, and there are both Python and JS examples in the ecosystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where to learn more and get started\n",
      "- Python usage and API surface: langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters on GitHub. Typical workflow involves creating a MultiServerMCPClient, loading tools via get_tools, and passing them to a LangChain agent.\n",
      "- JavaScript/TypeScript usage: langchainjs-mcp-adapters on GitHub (LangChain.js MCP adapters).\n",
      "- Official docs (LangChain): Model Context Protocol (MCP) page and the MCP docs, which describe how to connect to MCP servers, get tools, and use them with agents (including lifecycle management and elicitation).\n",
      "- Changelogs and announcements: LangChain changelog entries about “MCP Adapters for LangChain and LangGraph” and the 0.2.0 release, which highlight new features like multimodal support, elicitation, structured artifacts, and per-server tool naming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick-start sketch (Python)\n",
      "- Create an MCP client that points at your MCP servers\n",
      "  - client = MultiServerMCPClient({ mcpServers: { math: { transport: \"stdio\", command: \"python\", args: [\"path/to/math_server.py\"] }, weather: { url: \"https://example.com/weather/mcp\" } } })\n",
      "- Load tools from servers\n",

The **LangChain MCP Adapters** is a package that makes it easy to use **Anthropic Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools** with LangChain & LangGraph. * Converts **MCP tools** into **LangChain- & LangGraph-compatible tools**. * Enables interaction with tools across multiple **MCP servers**. * Seamlessly integrates the **hundreds of tool servers** already published into LangGraph Agents. ### Why use MCP Adapters:. This adapter makes it simple to connect LangChain and LangGraph with the growing ecosystem of MCP tool servers. Instead of manually adapting each tool, you can now integrate them seamlessly. It also allows agents to pull from multiple MCP servers at once, making it easier to combine different tools for more powerful applications. MCP is gaining serious traction, and this adapter helps LangGraph agents take full advantage. ##### Subscribe to updates.\",\\n      \"score\": 0.9999956,\\n      \"raw_content\": null\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"url\": \"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/mcp-adapters\",\\n      \"title\": \"langchain/mcp-adapters - NPM\",\\n      \"content\": \"import{createAgent} from \\\\\"langchain\\\\\"; import{ChatOpenAI} from\\\\\"@langchain/openai\\\\\"; import{MultiServerMCPClient} from\\\\\"@langchain/mcp-adapters\\\\\";// Create client and connect to server const client = new MultiServerMCPClient({// Global tool configuration options// Whether to throw on errors if a tool fails to load (optional, default: true) throwOnLoadError true,// Whether to prefix tool names with the server name (optional, default: false) prefixToolNameWithServerName false,// Optional additional prefix for tool names (optional, default: \\\\\"\\\\\") additionalToolNamePrefix \\\\\"\\\\\",// Use standardized content block format in tool outputs useStandardContentBlocks true,// Behavior when a server fails to connect: \\\\\"throw\\\\\" (default) or \\\\\"ignore\\\\\" onConnectionError \\\\\"ignore\\\\\",// Server configuration mcpServers{// adds a STDIO connection to a server named \\\\\"math\\\\\" math{transport \\\\\"stdio\\\\\", command \\\\\"npx\\\\\", args[\\\\\"-y\\\\\",\\\\\"@modelcontextprotocol/server-math\\\\\"],// Restart configuration for stdio transport restart{enabled true, maxAttempts 3, delayMs 1000,},},// here\\'s a filesystem server filesystem{transport \\\\\"stdio\\\\\", command \\\\\"npx\\\\\", args[\\\\\"-y\\\\\",\\\\\"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\\\\\"],},// Sreamable HTTP transport example, with auth headers and automatic SSE fallback disabled (defaults to enabled) weather{url\\\\\"https://example.com/weather/mcp\\\\\", headers{Authorization \\\\\"Bearer token123\\\\\",} automaticSSEFallback false},// OAuth 2.0 authentication (recommended for secure servers)\\\\\"oauth-protected-server\\\\\"{url\\\\\"https://protected.example.com/mcp\\\\\", authProvider new MyOAuthProvider({// Your OAuth provider implementation redirectUrl\\\\\"https://myapp.com/oauth/callback\\\\\", clientMetadata{redirect_uris[\\\\\"https://myapp.com/oauth/callback\\\\\"], client_name \\\\\"My MCP Client\\\\\", scope\\\\\"mcp:read mcp:write\\\\\"}}),// Can still include custom headers for non-auth purposes headers{\\\\\"User-Agent\\\\\"\\\\\"My-MCP-Client/1.0\\\\\"}},// how to force SSE, for old servers that are known to only support SSE (streamable HTTP falls back automatically if unsure) github{transport \\\\\"sse\\\\\",// also works with \\\\\"type\\\\\" field instead of \\\\\"transport\\\\\" url\\\\\"https://example.com/mcp\\\\\", reconnect{enabled true, maxAttempts 5, delayMs 2000,},},},}); const tools = await client.\",\\n      \"score\": 0.99997115,\\n      \"raw_content\": null\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"url\": \"https://changelog.langchain.com/announcements/langchain-mcp-adapters-0-2-0\",\\n      \"title\": \"LangChain MCP Adapters 0.2.0\",\\n      \"content\": \"LangChain - Changelog | LangChain MCP Adapters 0.2.0.

The **LangChain MCP Adapters** is a package that makes it easy to use **Anthropic Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools** with LangChain & LangGraph. * Converts **MCP tools** into **LangChain- & LangGraph-compatible tools**. * Enables interaction with tools across multiple **MCP servers**. * Seamlessly integrates the **hundreds of tool servers** already published into LangGraph Agents. ### Why use MCP Adapters:. This adapter makes it simple to connect LangChain and LangGraph with the growing ecosystem of MCP tool servers. Instead of manually adapting each tool, you can now integrate them seamlessly. It also allows agents to pull from multiple MCP servers at once, making it easier to combine different tools for more powerful applications. MCP is gaining serious traction, and this adapter helps LangGraph agents take full advantage. ##### Subscribe to updates.\",\\n      \"score\": 0.82492816,\\n      \"raw_content\": null\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/box-community/langchain-box-mcp-adapter\",\\n      \"title\": \"box-community/langchain-box-mcp-adapter\",\\n      \"content\": \"box-community   /  **langchain-box-mcp-adapter**  Public.
